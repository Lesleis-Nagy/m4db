Introduction
============

The micromagnetic model metadata database (m4db) is a suite of software to
manage large collections of micromagnetic models. The m4db is split over
several components as shown in figure :numref:`m4db-overview`. This manual is
split in to two parts. First there is a description of the
user-level scripts shown in :numref:`m4db-database-functions`. The second part
of this manual is a detailed explanation of the API which is useful for
developers of m4db.
